# AFitnessWeeklyScheduler

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.9.

## Packages

Bootstrap 5

## To discuss

1. I needed to use "this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;" in order to force reload page on params change. Otherwise all listeners on activities would get bugged.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
